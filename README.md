**Disclaimer:** I'm not a hiring guru or a recruitment wizard, just a fellow navigator in the vast sea of job opportunities. This is a personal collection of tips to help you sail smoothly through the job-hunting waters. Let's dive in!

## Template and Basics:

- âœ… **Template Time:** Pick an Application Tracking System(ATS) friendly [template](https://assets.ctfassets.net/pdf29us7flmy/6NLdBCISS0n7kzd0UZQqVS/aa489033ab3d9d9a47cb845251dd481f/ATS_Resume_Template.docx).
- âœ… **Contact Connection:** Include your mobile digits and a professional email. Skip the pigeon post address.
- âœ… **Tailor-Made Summary:** Align your summary with the job description. Write a mini-biography without sounding like a Shakespearean tragedy.
- âœ… **One Page Wonder:** Keep it short and sweet. Your resume should be like a good joke â€“ impactful and under one page.
- âœ… **Keyword Couture:** Sprinkle in some job description keywords to make your resume play nice with the ATS. Yes, the bots are watching!
- âœ… **Company Charm:** Mention the company you're applying to. It's like whispering sweet nothings for your resume.
- âœ… **Lead with a Bang:** Your first resume item should scream, "I'm what you're looking for!" Set the tone!
- âœ… **Title Triumph:** Make your experience titles pop with value.
- âœ… **Link it Up:** Got an online presence? Slap that LinkedIn and github link on there. It's like a virtual handshake before the interview.
- âœ… **Pronoun Patrol:** Avoid "I"; let your achievements do the talking.
- âœ… **Buzzword Block:** Buzzwords are so last season. Let your achievements speak louder than clichÃ©s.
- âœ… **Soft Skills Salsa:** Highlight your soft skills â€“ the graceful moves in your professional dance routine.
- âœ… **Font Finesse:** ATS bots are traditional, so stick to classic fonts.
- âœ… **Font Size Foxtrot:** Keep the size in the 10-12 range. No magnifying glasses needed.
- âœ… **Text File Test:** Export the resume text to a .txt file; check for weird characters and symbols. No robo-confusion allowed.
- âœ… **Verb Verve:** Power up with action words. Be the superhero your resume deserves!
- âœ… **Quantify Quest:** Measure everything in impact. Quantify achievements but don't turn it into a math class. No one wants resume calculus.
- âœ… **Skillful Showdown:** Showcase only the skills that are the heroes of the job description. Leave the extras in the Batcave.
- âœ… **Section Selection:** Keep only the impressive sections â€“ Experience, Projects, Education, and Technical Skills. It's a resume, not a novel.
- âœ… **Customize Customize Customize:** Customize for each job, like you're writing a different love letter each time. PRO TIP: If you are into LaTeX, use this [tool](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/create-perfect-resume-each-application-using-latex-git-john-rodgers-zbh9f/) from John for easy customization.
- âœ… **Typo Tango:** Proofread like your English teacher is watching. Typos are like spinach in your teeth during a date.
- âœ… **Modern Minimalist:** Keep your resume between **475-600** words. Yes, it's been [researched](https://cultivatedculture.com/resume-statistics/)!

## Showcasing Your Brilliance:

- âœ… **Certification Celebration:** If you're certified, brag a bit. Professional certificates, not "World's Best Dancer."
- âœ… **Work Experience Waltz:** Your career journeyâ€”chronologically, not a time-travel adventure.
- âœ… **Education Elegance:** Include academic details. No need for a dissertation on kindergarten achievements.

## Networking and Communication Mambo:

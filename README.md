BIG Disclaimer: I'm not a hiring guru or a recruitment wizard, just a fellow navigator in the vast sea of job opportunities. This is a personal collection of tips to help you sail smoothly through the job-hunting waters. Let's dive in!

âœ… Template Time: Pick a snazzy resume template from resumemaker.online https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/ats-resume-template

âœ… Contact Info: Include your mobile digits and a professional email. Skip the pigeon post address.

âœ… Tailor made summary: Tailor the summary to match the job description. Write a mini-biography without sounding like a Shakespearean tragedy. Keep it peppy!

âœ… One Page Wonder: Keep it short and sweet. Your resume should be like a good joke â€“ impactful and under one page.

âœ… Keyword Couture: Keywords are your seasoning. Sprinkle in some job description keywords to make your resume play nice with the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Yes, the robots are watching! :

âœ… Company Charm: Name-drop the company you're applying to. It's like whispering sweet nothings but for your resume.

âœ… Lead with a Bang: Your first resume item should scream, "I'm what you're looking for!" Think of it like the opening act at a concert â€“ set the tone!

âœ… Title Triumph: Make your experience titles pop. No, not with glitter, but with value. Show what you've brought to the table.

âœ… Link it Up: Got an online presence? Slap that LinkedIn link on there. It's like a virtual handshake before the interview.

âœ… Quantify Quest: Measure everything in impact. Quantify achievements but don't turn it into a math class. No one wants resume calculus.

âœ… Customize Casanova: Customize for each job, like you're writing a different love letter each time. But keep it professional, Casanova.

âœ… Typo Tango: Proofread like your English teacher is watching. Typos are like spinach in your teeth during a date.

âœ… File Format Fandango: Export the resume text to a .txt file and give it a look. Mae sure there are no special characters that can confuse the ATS bots. Nobody wants robo-confusion.

âœ… Font Finesse: ATS is a bit traditional, so stick to the classics like Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Garamond and Georgia. Fonts shouldnâ€™t be a wild fashion statement; it's not a resume runway. 

âœ… Simplicity Samba: Keep formatting simple. Think of it as a dance â€“ the smoother, the better.

âœ… Certications: If you're certified, brag a bit. Just remember, we're talking professional certificates, not "World's Best Dancer."

âœ… Work Experience:: Your career journeyâ€”chronologically, not a time-travel adventure.

âœ… Education: Throw in your academic life details. No need for a dissertation on kindergarten achievements.

Save in a format ATS understands, not a secret code. No PDFs unless the job ad is demanding one.

Bullet Points:
âœ… Use regular bullets. Save the fancy ones for your secret recipe, not your resume.

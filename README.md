# Resume Checklist - Your GPS to Landing That Dream Job!

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a hiring guru or a recruitment wizard, just a fellow navigator in the vast sea of job opportunities. This is a personal collection of tips to help you sail smoothly through the job-hunting waters. Let's dive in!

## Template and Basics:

- âœ… **Template Time:** Pick a snazzy resume template from [resumemaker.online](https://www.resumemaker.online/) or [this ATS-friendly one](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/ats-resume-template).
- âœ… **Contact Info:** Include your mobile digits and a professional email. Skip the pigeon post address.
- âœ… **Tailor-Made Summary:** Match the summary to the job description. Keep it peppy and not too Shakespearean.
- âœ… **One Page Wonder:** Keep it short and sweet. Your resume should be like a good joke â€“ impactful and under one page.
- âœ… **Keyword Couture:** Sprinkle in job description keywords for ATS friendliness.
- âœ… **Company Charm:** Name-drop the company you're applying to. It's like whispering sweet nothings but for your resume.
- âœ… **Lead with a Bang:** Your first resume item should scream, "I'm what you're looking for!" Set the tone!
- âœ… **Title Triumph:** Make your experience titles pop with value.
- âœ… **Link it Up:** Got an online presence? Slap that LinkedIn link on there. It's like a virtual handshake before the interview.
- âœ… **Pronoun Patrol:** "I" is out; let your achievements do the talking.
- âœ… **Buzzword Block:** Skip the buzzwords. Let your achievements speak louder than clichÃ©s.

## Tech Tools for Job Seekers:

- âœ… **Text File Test:** Export the resume text to a .txt file. No robo-confusion allowed.
- âœ… **Font Finesse:** Stick to classic fonts for ATS friendliness.
- âœ… **Simplicity Samba:** Keep formatting simple. The smoother, the better.

## Showcasing Your Brilliance:

- âœ… **Certifications:** If you're certified, brag a bit. Professional certificates, not "World's Best Dancer."
- âœ… **Contact Info Clarity:** Make it easy for recruiters. No magnifying glasses needed.
- âœ… **Work Experience:** Your career journeyâ€”chronologically, not a time-travel adventure.
- âœ… **Education:** Throw in academic details. No need for a dissertation on kindergarten achievements.

## Networking and Communication Mambo:

- âœ… **LinkedIn Love:** Share, comment, connect â€“ keep the LinkedIn dance alive.

## Miscellaneous Mamba:

- âœ… **Tool Tango:** Use tools like Jobscan and Resumeworded for optimal ATS performance.
- âœ… **Apply Early Ballet:** Be the prima ballerina of applications â€“ graceful, timely, and stealing the show.
- âœ… **Follow-Up Flamenco:** Two follow-ups max. Don't be the stalker at the dance party.
- âœ… **Cover Letter Carnival:** Craft a cover letter that's a party in prose.

## Finishing Touches:

- âœ… **Clean Up Your Digital Footprint:** Clear out social media posts that don't align with your professional image.
- âœ… **LinkedIn Optimization Ballet:** Keep your LinkedIn profile in sync with your resume.
- âœ… **Resume Word Limit Waltz:** Keep your resume between 400-600 words.
- âœ… **Soft Skills Salsa:** Highlight your soft skills â€“ the graceful moves in your professional dance routine.
- âœ… **Jobscan Match Dance:** Before you hit the apply button, dance with Jobscan. Ensure your resume and the job listing are in perfect sync.

**Remember:** This checklist is my way of throwing some confetti into your job search. It's not a hiring decree, just a friendly favor. Now, put on your dancing shoes, and let's choreograph your career success! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•ºðŸŒŸ
